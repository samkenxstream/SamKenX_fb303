 *
 * This makes it fairly easy to use as a drop-in replacement for call sites
 * that were previously using the ServiceData APIs to update stats by name.
 * A ThreadLocalStatsMap object can be used instead of the fbData singleton,
 * and the stat update operations will become faster thread local operations in
 * order to reduce or eliminate lock contention.
 *
 * However, note that accessing statistics by name is less efficient than
 * defining your own TLTimeseries or TLHistogram counters and accessing them
 * directly, as it requires a string lookup on each update operation.  Where
 * possible, prefer to define your own ThreadLocalStats subclass so you can
 * directly access counter member variables rather than having to perform
 * string lookups on each update operation.
